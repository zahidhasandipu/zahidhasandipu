Hi, I am Zahid Hasan. You can call me Dipu 🙌🏻

During my 8th standard, while my friends decided to pursue science, I decided to go with business because I wanted real-world business experience. Although working with data as an industry executive was a good experience, I wanted something challenging rather than regular data input and preparing financial statements. So I dived into the data world and completed my MS in Data Science. While doing that, I got to explore the software industry, and I found it exhilarating. I am currently learning MERN Stack (Mongo BD, Express JS, React JS, Node JS) to gain further knowledge. My greatest strength is I never fear making bold decisions. I am unique because I came from a business background, explored data science, and now implementing all those perspectives in the software industry. In my free time, I explore the history of different countries, love playing soccer, big Champions League Football fan. Ex-student leader and fastest man of Comilla Education Board.
